## 📌 Description

`fract-ol` is a graphical project from the 42 curriculum.  
The objective is to **render famous mathematical fractals** in real time using the C language
and the MiniLibX graphics library.

This project explores:
- Complex numbers
- Iterative mathematical systems
- Pixel-level rendering
- Real-time interaction (keyboard & mouse)

## 🧠 What Is a Fractal?

A **fractal** is a mathematical shape that:
- Has infinite detail 🔍
- Shows self-similarity at different zoom levels
- Is generated by repeatedly applying a simple equation

In this project:
- Each **pixel** represents a **complex number**
- We repeatedly apply a formula to that number
- The pixel color depends on how fast the value escapes to infinity

---

## 🔢 Core Equation

All fractals in this project are based on the equation:

```
z = z² + c
```

Where:
- `z` is a complex number
- `c` is another complex number

The equation is repeated many times (**iterations**).

If at any point:

```
|z| > 2
```

Then the value is considered **escaped** ❌  
If it never escapes after the maximum number of iterations, it belongs to the fractal ✅

## 🌀 Mandelbrot vs 🎭 Julia (IMPORTANT)

### 🌀 Mandelbrot Set

For Mandelbrot:
- `z` **always starts at 0**
- `c` comes from the **pixel position**
- Every pixel has a different `c`

So we are asking:
> Which values of `c` stay stable when starting from `z = 0`?

Typical range:
- Real axis: **-2 → +1**
- Imaginary axis: **-1.5 → +1.5**

---

### 🎭 Julia Set

For Julia:
- `c` is **fixed** (chosen by the user)
- `z` starts from the **pixel position**

So we are asking:
> How do all starting values of `z` behave with the SAME `c`?

Each different `c` produces a **completely different Julia fractal** 🤯

Recommended values:
- `-2.0 ≤ c.real ≤ 2.0`
- `-2.0 ≤ c.imag ≤ 2.0`

## 🎨 Coloring Logic (Escape-Time Algorithm)

The color of each pixel depends on **how fast `z` escapes**.

### Coloring rules:
- 🟡 Escapes fast (few iterations) → **bright color**
- 🔵 Escapes slowly → **darker color**
- ⚫ Never escapes → **black**

This technique highlights the fractal boundary and creates smooth gradients.

## 🖥️ Controls & Interaction

### 🖱️ Zoom
- **Mouse wheel** → zoom in / zoom out
- **`+` key** → zoom in
- **`-` key** → zoom out

### 🎮 Movement
- **Arrow keys** → move the fractal view (up, down, left, right)

### 🎨 Colors
- **`C` key** → shift color palette

### 🔄 Iterations
- **`I` key** → increase maximum iterations
- **`U` key** → decrease maximum iterations

Higher iterations = more detail but slower rendering.

### ⚡ Julia Real-Time Parameters
*(Julia set only)*

- **`B` key** → increase `c` value
- **`V` key** → decrease `c` value

This allows **real-time morphing of the Julia fractal** while the program is running 🔥

### ❌ Exit
- **ESC key** or window close button

---

## ⚙️ Compilation

```bash
make
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
./fractol mandelbrot
./fractol julia
```

With custom Julia parameters:

```bash
./fractol julia -0.7 0.27015
```

---

## 🧠 Implementation Overview

1. Convert pixel coordinates to complex plane
2. Apply `z = z² + c` iteratively
3. Detect escape condition
4. Calculate color based on iteration count
5. Write pixel to image buffer
6. Render image using MiniLibX

Optimizations:
- Drawing to image buffer instead of window
- Avoiding unnecessary recalculations
- Real-time parameter updates without restart
